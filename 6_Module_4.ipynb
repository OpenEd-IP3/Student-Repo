    "\n",
    "We start by driving on a straight line, and consider a simple model of longitudinal KITT dynamics,\n",
    "described by Newton’s second law, $F=m a$. The car’s motion with mass $m$ is influenced by the following three forces:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $F_{motor}$: The driving force provided by the motor.\n",
    "- $F_{friction}$: The frictional force opposing the motion, which is proportional to the velocity, $F_{friction} = -b  v$, where $b$ is the friction coefficient.\n",
    "- $F_{{air}}$: The air resistance, which is proportional to the square of the velocity, $F_{{air}} = -c * v^2$, where c is the air resistance coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The net resulting force acting on the car can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{{res}} = F_{{motor}} - b v - c v^2 $$\n",

    " *Indicate the forces and their directions.* \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that another force acting on the car could be the braking force $F_b$. \n",
    "Unfortunately, KITT does not have a brake! You can stop by letting KITT roll to standstill, or for a\n",
    "short period apply a negative force $F_{motor}$. The difference with a real brake is that if you apply $F_{motor}$ for\n",
    "too long, or were already stopped, the car will drive backwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Newton's Second Law of Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Newton's second law, the net force acting on the car is equal to the mass of the car times its acceleration:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Velocity as a Function of Time\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the velocity as a function of time, we need to solve the differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{F_{{motor}}}{m} - \\frac{b}{m} v - \\frac{c}{m} v^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a nonlinear differential equation due to the $v^2$ term. However, if air resistance is small compared to friction, we can neglect the $ v^2$  term for a simplified model:\n",

To find the other parameters, we will closely examine the velocity equation and write some code to make measurements on the car. This part is less guided so you will have to find some of your own sollutions. Remember that the velocity equation is\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that for sufficiently large $t$, we see that the velocity becomes constant: $v(\\infty) = \\frac{F_{{motor}}}{b}$. This is called the terminal velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding the Friction Coefficient $b$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Measure Terminal Velocity:**\n",
    "   - Run the car at a motor command setting of interest towards a wall. Measure the velocity as the car accelerates until $v_{\\infty}$ is reached. For this you can use the distance sensors. _Please place one of the bumber boxes in front of the car to stop it from crashing into the wall._ Transform these distance measurements into a velocity plot (remove duplicates and merge the L and R sensor data).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Initial Acceleration:**\n",
    "   - At the very beginning of the motion, the car starts from rest, and the initial velocity $v(0) = 0$. At this point, frictional forces are negligible since $v$ is small, and the acceleration $dv/dt$ can be approximated by\n",
    "     $$ \\frac{dv}{dt} \\approx \\frac{F_{{motor}}}{m} $$\n",
    "   - Measure the acceleration of the car from rest. This can be done by measuring the speed at two very close time intervals after the car starts moving and calculating the acceleration using\n",
    "     $$ a_0 = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate $F_{motor}$:**\n",
    "   - Use the measured initial acceleration $a_0$ to calculate the motor force:\n",
    "     $$ F_{{motor}} = m \\cdot a_0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate $b$ Using Terminal Velocity:**\n",
    "   - With $F_{{motor}}$ known, use the measured terminal velocity $v_\\infty$ to calculate the friction coefficient $b$:\n",
    "     $$ b = \\frac{F_{{motor}}}{v_{{\\infty}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above process is just one approach. Using measured data, it might be less accurate because it requires you to make a velocity plot (taking numerical derivatives magnifies noise) and then even a second derivative ($a_0$). Alternatively, you can work with a plot of position vs time, and measure the terminal velocity as the slope of the plot for larger time. The time constant $\\tau = m/b$ can be determined from a velocity plot by marking the time where the velocity is $1/e \\approx 0.368$ of its final value. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have estimated your parameters, plot the resulting model curves (for velocity and position) on top of the measured curves. Comment on these plots: how well is the fitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "- $F_{{motor}}$ depends on the speed setting, and also on the battery status; it will have to be measured again if these values change. For your application, you probably need only one or two speed settings, but you can try to make a calibration table for multiple battery levels.\n",
    "\n",

    "We choose to measure $R$ with respect to the rear axle. From the geometry, we can then derive the following two equations:\n",

    "- $\\omega = \\frac{v}{R}$\n",

    "- $2\\pi R = v T \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{2\\pi R}\\cdot v = \\frac{v}{R}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The expression $R = L/\\tan(\\delta)$ can be used to create a calibration table: for various steering commands, we measure the resulting $R$ and compute the corresponding $\\delta$. If we then apply a new (uncalibrated) angle setting, we can interpolate the table to find $\\delta$ and then calculate the corresponding radius $R$.\n",
