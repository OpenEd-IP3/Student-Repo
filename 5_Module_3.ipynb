    "\n",
    "In the first week assignments, you developed algorithms for channel estimation using signals received at two microphones. In this module, we extend this to 5 microphones and use this to locate the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Channel Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The channel estimation problem is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we transmit a known signal \\( x[n] \\) over a communication channel and measure the received signal \\( y[n] \\). The channel acts as a filter, which we will assume to be linear and time-invariant (LTI). Therefore, the received signal is a convolution of the transmitted signal by the channel impulse response \\( h[n] \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y[n] = x[n] * h[n]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the transmitted signal $x[n]$, can we recover the impulse response of the communication channel $h[n]$ from $y[n]$? This is essentially an inversion problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Channel Estimation Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods for channel estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deconvolution in Time Domain (ch1):** Involves matrix inversion. It is computationally complex and requires lots of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Matched Filter (ch2):** Avoids matrix inversion by computing the cross-correlation of $y[n]$ with $x[n]$. The channel estimate is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{h}[n] = y[n] * x[-n]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This method depends heavily on having a reference signal with good autocorrelation properties: $r[n] = x[n] * x[-n]$ should resemble a delta-spike.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deconvolution in Frequency Domain (ch3):** Involves using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Convolution in time becomes multiplication in frequency, so deconvolution becomes division in the frequency domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{H}[k] = \\frac{Y[k]}{X[k]}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the channel impulse response $ \\hat{h}[n] $ is obtained by taking the inverse FFT of $ \\hat{H}[k] $.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is efficient but requires handling divisions by zero or very small values, which can be achieved by thresholding. Apart from edge effects, the result should be identical to that of **ch1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We recommend using method **ch3** (Deconvolution in Frequency Domain) for this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)\n",
    "\n",
    "After estimating the channel impulse response for each microphone, we can detect the first incoming path (the direct path from KITT to the microphone). This corresponds to the propagation delay of the car beacon to each microphone. However, since we do not know the exact transmission time, we can only obtain relative propagation delays. By taking the differences of these delays between pairs of microphones, we eliminate the unknown transmission time, resulting in Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "These TDOA measurements can be used to estimate the position of KITT in the field.\n"

    "## Step 1: Implementing Channel Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the provided reference signal and your channel estimation algorithm (ch3: deconvolution in the frequency domain), deconvolve the recordings to obtain the channel impulse response for each microphone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and Normalize the Recorded and Reference Signal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The reference signal is provided as a WAV file recorded close to one of the microphones.\n",
    "   - Normalize the signals to have a maximum amplitude of 1. This is important because the amplitude of the received signals may vary depending on the microphone.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Segment the Signals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Manually extract a single pulse from the reference signal and the recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implement the Channel Estimation Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Use ch3 to estimate the channel impulse response.\n",
    "   - Be sure to handle divisions by zero or very small values in the frequency domain by applying a threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes and Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalization:** You can normalize a signal by dividing it by its maximum absolute value:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  ref_signal = ref_signal / np.max(np.abs(ref_signal))\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FFT Length:** When performing convolution or deconvolution via FFT, ensure that the FFT length is sufficient to avoid \"circular convolution\" effects (you will learn about this in EE3S1). Calculate `N = len(ref_pulse) + len(rec_pulse) - 1`, and zero-pad both ref_pulse and rec_pulse to length $N$ before doing the FFT. This ensures that circular convolution becomes linear convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Thresholding:** Adjust the threshold value based on the magnitude of the FFT of the reference signal. Experiment with different threshold values to find one that works well, starting with a small value (e.g., 1e-6)."

    "### After the Midterm: Reference Signal and Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have completed this module successfully, you can start integrating and estimating the car’s location from your own microphone measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reference Signal Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a good beacon signal is important, because it determines the quality of your location estimates. Since the time in IP3 is limited, we will give a few general hints, but note that the topic could be explored in much more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your ch3 algorithm (deconvolution in frequency domain), you have seen that we omit all frequencies where the beacon signal amplitude spectrum $|X(F)|$ is small, because we divide by $X(F)$ and this would blow up the noise. For best results, we want $X(F)$ to be large for all frequencies. Therefore, ideally, we have a flat power spectrum. For random signals, this corresponds to the use of \"white noise\".   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Beacon code** Our beacon code consists of 32 bits, each 0 or 1. White noise corresponds to a beacon code for which the autocorrelation resembles a delta spike. You could generate a bit code using 'rand', and then round to 0 or 1. A further consideration is that the code should start and end with '1', or else you are using in fact a code that is shorter than 32 bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "After generating a code, check its autocorrelation function, $x[n]\\ast x[-n]$. \n",
    "You want a strong peak for the 0-lag of the autocorrelation but as low as possible for any other lag.\n",
    "*Hint:* Randomly generated codes are suitable for our purposes. You could try some optimal codes (check communication theory literature for “gold codes”).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Carrier frequency and bit frequency** The carrier frequency defines the \"pitch\" of the transmitted signal. Since we use audio equipment which is optimized for human listening, it is better to use carriers below 10 kHz. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bit frequency determines the bandwidth of the transmitted signal. Since we want to probe the channel on as many different frequencies as possible, we would select a large bit frequency (but it can't be larger than the carrier frequency). The hardware implementation seems to limit the total output power. If we use a wider bandwidth, the energy per hertz is reduced. Thus, there is a trade-off. You can try to find good values experimentally, i.e. try a range of bit frequencies in steps of 1000 Hz, and see which setting gives most accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A perfect repetition count is not yet required; but you need to make sure that the full code can be transmitted and recorded on all microphones within the same recording window.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Field Testing:** A theoretical signal may not work well in practice. Use your field test time well. Consider recording a bunch of different audio beacon settings and analyzing them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Make Test Recording**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Record the signal transmitted over KITT’s beacon with your selected parameters.\n",
    "- Place the microphone close to KITT’s beacon to get a clean recording.\n",
    "- Avoid clipping by adjusting recording levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Create Reference Signal**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the recording into Python.\n",
    "- Clean it by removing zero intervals and extracting a single pulse.\n",
    "- Use this as your reference signal in deconvolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Test Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Place KITT at a known location (e.g., the center of the field).\n",
    "- Make recordings and run your localization algorithm.\n",
    "- Evaluate the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Integrate with Recording Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine your localization algorithm with the recording code.\n",
    "- Address any issues such as blocking recording.\n",
    "- Aim to locate KITT in real-time while it is moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Optional Refinement**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add timestamp information to your location estimates.\n",
    "- Consider the delays between recording, processing, and KITT's movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverable (Final Report)\n",

    "Show your selected beacon parameters and comment on the resulting performance.\n",

    "- **Real-time Operation:** Are you able to drive and locate KITT simultaneously in real-time?\n",
    "- **Discussion:** Address any challenges faced and how you overcame them.\n",
